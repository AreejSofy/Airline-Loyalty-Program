# Airline Customer Analysis & Visualization

A data analysis project focused on cleaning flight customer data using **Python** and creating an analytical dashboard in **Power BI**.

## Objective
To process raw aviation data and visualize key customer metrics, such as membership tiers and demographic distribution.

## Tech Stack
* **Cleaning:** Python (Pandas)
* **Analysis:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Visualization:** Power BI (`.pbix`)

## Key Steps
1.  **Data Cleaning:** * Handled missing values in the `Age` column using the mean.
    * Removed duplicate records.
    * Standardized column names for better readability (e.g., `FFP_TIER` to `Frequent Flyer Program Tier`).
2.  **Visualization:**
    * Designed a Power BI dashboard to track customer gender, membership levels, and flight history.

## Project Structure
* `Python_Cleaning.ipynb`: Data preprocessing script.
* `charts.pbix`: Interactive Power BI dashboard.
